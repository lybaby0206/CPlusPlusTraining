Ways to approach a general Design problem
  Use Cases Generation: Gather all the possible use cases
  Constraints and Analysis: How many users, how much data etc
  Basic Design: Most basic design. Few users case
  Bottlenecks: Find the bottlenecks and solve them
  Scalability: A large number of users; 4 and 5 step will go in loop till we get a satisfactory answer

Current Scenario
  Use cases for this problem
    Parking can be single-level or multilevel
    Types of vehicles that can be parked, separate spaces for each type of vehicle
    Entry and exit points.
  Constraints
    Number of vehicles that can be accommodated of any type
    Basic Design/High-Level Components
    Vehicle/Type of vehicle
    Entry and Exit points
    Different spots for vehicles
  Bottlenecks
    Capacity breach for any type of vehicle
  Scalability
    Scalable from single-level to multi-level
    Scalable from Bike only parking to accommodate all kinds of vehicles

Keeping these in minds, APIs can be designed in the language of your preference.
